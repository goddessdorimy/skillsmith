Milestone: v0.1 Initial Release — COMPLETE
Phase: 6 of 6 complete
Plan: All plans complete
Status: Milestone complete
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — Phase 5 (Audit) complete, milestone closed

Progress:
- Milestone: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plans | Total Time | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| 01-syntax-specs | 2/2 | ~17 min | 8.5 min |
| 02-skillsmith-discovery | 1/1 | ~5 min | 5 min |
| 03-skillsmith-scaffolding | 1/1 | ~3 min | 3 min |
| 3.1-skillsmith-distill | 1/1 | ~3 min | 3 min |
| 04-validation | 1/1 | organic | N/A |
| 05-audit | 1/1 | ~5 min | 5 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
| Decision | Phase | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Placeholder: [square]=prose, {curly}=variable | 01-01 | Cross-cutting convention |
| Entry points: 5 XML sections | 01-01 | activation, persona, commands, routing, greeting |
| Context is only mutable file type | 01-02 | Everything else is stable reference |
| Rules in meta-skill only | 01-02 | Individual skills don't carry rulebook |
| Discovery uses 5 conversational phases | 02-01 | Identity, Persona, Scope, Architecture, Review |
| Skill spec as contract between discover/scaffold | 02-01 | Structured output consumed by scaffolding |
| Rules as compact enforcement, not spec copies | 03-01 | Must Have + Anti-Patterns extracted from specs |
| 6 rules files, no rules-for-rules | 03-01 | One per consumer folder type |
| Chunk by functional outcome, not source structure | 3.1-01 | Chunks grouped by what they help you DO |
| Chunks stand alone — no cross-chunk dependencies | 3.1-01 | Each chunk independently loadable |
| Audit as reusable workflow, not one-off task | 05-01 | /skillsmith audit available on demand |

### Deferred Issues
None.

## Phase 1 Deliverables

All 7 specs in `specs/`:
- `entry-point.md`, `tasks.md`, `templates.md`, `frameworks.md`, `context.md`, `checklists.md`, `rules.md`

## Phase 2 Deliverables

- `skillsmith/skillsmith.md` — Suite entry point
- `skillsmith/tasks/discover.md` — 5-phase discovery interview
- `skillsmith/templates/skill-spec.md` — Skill spec output template

## Phase 3 Deliverables

- `skillsmith/tasks/scaffold.md` — Scaffolding workflow
- `skillsmith/rules/*.md` — 6 authoring rules files

## Phase 3.1 Deliverables

- `skillsmith/tasks/distill.md` — Source material → framework chunks workflow
- `skillsmith/skillsmith.md` — Updated with /skillsmith distill command

## Phase 4 Deliverables

- Validated organically — multiple skills created using /skillsmith in production use

## Phase 5 Deliverables

- `skillsmith/tasks/audit.md` — Audit workflow (single + batch modes)
- `skillsmith/skillsmith.md` — Updated with /skillsmith audit command (now 4 commands)
